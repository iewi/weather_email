# weather_email
a Python script to send an email of the weather conditions of the day

A little background: I decided to learn how to send emails programatically, and I've also been on a _major_ weather bender, because of that weather app I'm doing in class. Obviously, these things combined well, and now I have a script that sends a summary of the weather for today in email format.

For it to run, you'll have to have a gmail account and password to put in the email_config.py file to send from, and also an email address to send the email to.
